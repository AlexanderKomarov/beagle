{"name":"Open BEAGLE","tagline":"A generic C++ framework for evolutionary computation","body":"Open BEAGLE is a C++ Evolutionary Computation (EC) framework. It provides an high-level software environment to do any kind of EC, with support for tree-based genetic programming; bit string, integer-valued vector, and real-valued vector genetic algorithms; and evolution strategy.\r\n\r\nThe Open BEAGLE architecture follows strong principles of object oriented programming, where abstractions are represented by loosely coupled objects and where it is common and easy to reuse code. Open BEAGLE is designed to provide an EC environment that is generic, user friendly, portable, efficient, robust, elegant, and free.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### General features\r\n* Structured object oriented architecture\r\n* Smart pointers for automatic memory allocation management\r\n* Abstract factory, for runtime allocation of objects of any types\r\n* Parameters and algorithms dynamically configurable by files\r\n* Sophisticated logging mechanism with output in XML\r\n* Checkpoint mechanism for evolution recovery and results analysis\r\n* Population composed of multiple demes\r\n* History of best-of-run individuals for the whole population and for each demes\r\n* Population seeding from file\r\n* Master-slave model for parallel fitness evaluation\r\n\r\n### Specific representations and algorithms\r\n* Bit string representation with decoder functions (binary and Gray-coded)\r\n* Integer-valued vector representation\r\n* Indices permutation vector representation\r\n* Real-valued vector GA representation\r\n* Anisotropic Self-Adaptive Evolution strategy (SA-ES)\r\n* Covariance Matrix Adaptation ES (CMA-ES)\r\n* Multiobjective optimization (including NSGA-II)\r\n* Complete implementation of tree-based GP\r\n* Automatically defined functions (ADF) for GP\r\n* Constrained GP tree operators with support for strongly-typed GP\r\n* Co-evolution support based on multi-threading\r\n* Many examples for the various algorithms\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe current stable version is [3.0.3](http://code.google.com/p/beagle/downloads/detail?name=beagle-3.0.3.tar.gz), released on November 29, 2007. See the [Open BEAGLE Compilation HOWTO](http://code.google.com/p/beagle/downloads/detail?name=beagle-compil-howto-3.0.1-r1.pdf) for building instructions.\r\n\r\nThe current development version is [4.0.0-alpha2](http://code.google.com/p/beagle/downloads/detail?name=OpenBEAGLE-4.0.0-alpha2-Source.tar.gz), released on February 18, 2010.\r\n\r\nWith version 4.x, build system has been changed for [CMake](http://www.cmake.org), which provide a more elegant and portable building environment than the autotools. You also need to install [PACC version 1.4.1](http://code.google.com/p/beagle/downloads/detail?name=pacc-1.4.1-Source.tar.gz) beforehand, as it is no more included with the source distribution.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-17043837-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
